I am mainly supposed to serve images that are generated by AI in a website coded by AI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by prompts.
The use of semantic elements (header, main, nav, section, article, aside, footer) is expected in the HTML structure of the website.
The website design should be a responsive structure.
What do you think?


The website will be based on serving writings and images generated by AI.
First of all, I will use images generated by AI to show as cover photos for the writings generated by AI.
Provide me 5 writings(e.g. stories).
Writings should be at least in a length of  3000 characters.
Also, provide efficient prompts to use when creating every image cover for these related writings.


** Images are generated by given prompts **


I also got the images for covering the stories.
Now we have 10 stories and the images.
Let's start to create the website.
When the user selects the image, the story of it will be shown in a small frame that makes feel like reading a book.
There will be animation when the mouse points out to the image covers.
There will be a menu on the left with the titles of the stories listed.


** Some errors are fixed and arrangements are set **


Images and the stories should be in the center and smaller.
In the menu box, there should be Stories, About us and Contact.


Spread the 10 images and stories in the center over the entire page in a 10x10 format. Let there be 10 images and stories in each row and 10 in each column. You can use the same image-story sequence in each column.
When the user clicks on the image, their story will open right below it or in a new tab.


When clicking the stories, titles should be listed under stories.
Images are still too small, make them bigger.
Also I can only see 7 of the images properly from 10.
Do not comment the code.
