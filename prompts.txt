I am mainly supposed to serve images that are generated by AI in a website coded by AI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by prompts.
The use of semantic elements (header, main, nav, section, article, aside, footer) is expected in the HTML structure of the website.
The website design should be a responsive structure.
What do you think?


The website will be based on serving writings and images generated by AI.
First of all, I will use images generated by AI to show as cover photos for the writings generated by AI.
Provide me 5 writings(e.g. stories).
Writings should be at least in a length of 3000 characters.
Also, provide efficient prompts to use when creating every image cover for these related writings.


Provide 5 more writings.


** Images are generated by given prompts **


I also got the images for covering the stories.
Now we have 10 stories and the images.
Let's start to create the website.
When the user selects the image, the story of it will be shown in a small frame that makes feel like reading a book.
There will be animation when the mouse points out to the image covers.
There will be a menu on the left with the titles of the stories listed.


** Some errors are fixed and arrangements are set **


Images and the stories should be in the center and smaller.
When the user clicks on the image, their story will open right next to the images.
When clicking the stories in the menu, titles should be listed under stories.
Do not comment the code.


Provide me a README file. 
Keep in mind that this was a final project for completing Aygaz GenAI Bootcamp.
Project was based on prompt engineering.
